            <h3 class="title-3">HODL (Hold On for Dear Life)</h3>
            <p class="subtitle-3">
              A misspelling of "hold" that became a meme in the crypto space. It
              refers to keeping your crypto investments long-term instead of
              panic selling during market dips.

              The anxiety of seeing an asset skyrocket and feeling the urge to
              buy in at the last moment, often leading to bad trading decisions.
            </p>
            <p class="subtitle-3">
              <strong class="highlight">Example:</strong> "ETH is pumping, and I

              Negative news, rumors, or misinformation meant to cause panic and

            </p>
            <p class="subtitle-3">

              A scheme where the price of a cryptocurrency is artificially
              inflated (pumped) through hype before being sold off quickly
              (dumped), leaving late buyers with losses.
            </p>
