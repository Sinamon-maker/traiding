                <p class="subtitle-4">
                  Bitcoin is the world’s first cryptocurrency, created in 2009
                  by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto. It is a decentralized,
                  peer-to-peer digital currency that operates without the need
                  for banks or governments.
                </p>
                <h4 class="title-4">Why Was Bitcoin Created?</h4>
                <p class="subtitle-3">
                  Bitcoin was designed in response to the 2008 financial crisis.
                  It aims to be a trustless monetary system where no central
                  authority controls the money supply. Unlike fiat currencies
                  that can be printed endlessly, Bitcoin has a fixed supply of
                  21 million coins, ensuring its scarcity.

                  Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain created in 2015 by
                  Vitalik Buterin. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum is not just a
                  currency—it is a programmable blockchain that allows
                  developers to create decentralized applications (DApps).

                  Ethereum was designed to extend blockchain technology beyond
                  simple transactions. It introduced smart contracts, which
                  allow agreements to be executed automatically without
                  intermediaries. This laid the foundation for DeFi
                  (Decentralized Finance), NFTs, and Web3 applications.

                  Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, XRP does not rely on mining.
                  Instead, it uses a Unique Consensus Algorithm, where a network
                  of validators confirms transactions. This makes XRP more
                  energy- efficient and scalable than PoW-based systems.

                  Tether (USDT) is a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar.
                  Unlike other cryptocurrencies, which experience volatility,
                  USDT maintains a stable price, making it useful for trading
                  and payments.

                  Tether was introduced to provide stability in the crypto
                  market, allowing traders to hold value without leaving the
                  blockchain. Instead of converting back to fiat, traders can
                  use USDT to hedge against market downturns.

                  BNB is the native token of Binance, the world’s largest

                  trading discounts but has evolved into a multi-functional
